      <description>I like data, especially discovering interesting patterns in it. My car, a 2019 Honda Civic Hatchback produces an awful lot of it without even having to ask for it. This project is about collecting that data and having a look at it.&#xA;Vehicles manufactured after 1996 in the United States are required to implement OBD-II, an on-board diagnostics reporting capability.1 Luckily the standard requires a specific connector, placement, pinout, and permits a set of signaling protocols.</description>
